### Step 1: Create Your Project Directory
1. Create a new directory on your machine for your project.
   ```bash
   mkdir data_platform
   cd data_platform
   ```

### Step 2: Prepare Your dbt Project
1. Inside the `data_platform` directory, create a `dbt_project` directory where you’ll store your dbt project files.
   ```bash
   mkdir dbt_project
   ```
2. Place your dbt project files (like `dbt_project.yml`, `models`, etc.) in this `dbt_project` directory.

### Step 3: Create the Dockerfile
1. In the `data_platform` directory, create a `Dockerfile`.
   ```bash
   touch Dockerfile
   ```
2. Copy the Dockerfile content provided earlier into this file.

### Step 4: Create the Docker Compose File
1. In the same directory, create a `docker-compose.yml` file.
   ```bash
   touch docker-compose.yml
   ```
2. Copy the Docker Compose content provided earlier into this file.

### Step 5: Build and Run the Containers
1. In your terminal, navigate to the `data_platform` directory and run the following command to build the images and start the containers:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```
   - This command will build the necessary images and start the PostgreSQL, dbt, and Redash services.

### Step 6: Access Redash and dbt
1. Once everything is up and running, you can access Redash by opening your web browser and going to `http://localhost:5000`.
   - You can now configure Redash to connect to the PostgreSQL database and start visualizing your data.
   
2. The dbt project will run based on the commands defined in the Dockerfile. You can modify and rerun it as needed.

### Step 7: Manage the Containers
- To stop the services, press `Ctrl+C` in the terminal or run:
  ```bash
  docker-compose down
  ```
- To restart the services without rebuilding:
  ```bash
  docker-compose up
  ```

### Summary
This setup allows you to run PostgreSQL, dbt, and Redash in a networked Docker environment. The services can communicate with each other, enabling you to manage your database, run dbt transformations, and visualize the results in Redash—all within isolated containers.
