# Project Setup: Change Data Capture (CDC) with Debezium, Kafka, and MySQL

## Project Phases

### 1. Initial Setup and Configuration (50% of total fee) - $200
**Tasks:**
- **Install and Configure MySQL:**
  - Ensure MySQL is properly installed and configured.
  - Set up MySQL for binary logging, which is required by Debezium for CDC.
- **Set up Kafka and Zookeeper:**
  - Install and configure Kafka and Zookeeper.
- **Install and Configure Debezium:**
  - Set up Debezium connectors for MySQL.
  - Configure Debezium to monitor the required MySQL databases and tables.
- **Kafka Topics Setup:**
  - Create and configure Kafka topics to receive CDC events from MySQL.
- **Testing:**
  - Perform initial testing to ensure CDC events are captured correctly and published to Kafka.
- **Troubleshooting:**
  - Resolve any issues encountered during the setup.

### 2. Integration and Testing (30% of total fee) - $120
**Tasks:**
- **Consumer Integration:**
  - Integrate Kafka topics with downstream consumers (e.g., another database, a data warehouse, or a real-time analytics platform).
- **Load Testing:**
  - Conduct load testing to ensure the CDC setup can handle the expected data volume.
- **Performance Tuning:**
  - Optimize MySQL, Kafka, and Debezium configurations for optimal performance.
- **Data Consistency Checks:**
  - Verify the consistency and accuracy of data captured by Debezium.
- **Monitoring and Alerting:**
  - Set up monitoring and alerting for Kafka, Debezium, and MySQL to ensure the health and reliability of the CDC pipeline.

### 3. Documentation (20% of total fee) - $80
**Tasks:**
- **Technical Documentation:**
  - Overview of the CDC architecture with MySQL, Kafka, and Debezium.
  - Detailed step-by-step setup guide for MySQL, Kafka, Zookeeper, and Debezium.
  - Configuration details for MySQL (e.g., enabling binary logs), Kafka, and Debezium.
  - Troubleshooting guide for common issues.
- **Operational Documentation:**
  - Guidelines on monitoring and maintaining the CDC setup.
  - Instructions for scaling Kafka, MySQL, and Debezium.
  - Steps for adding or removing databases or tables from the CDC process.
  - Best practices for ongoing management and maintenance.

## Total Cost
- **Setup and Configuration:** $200
- **Integration and Testing:** $120
- **Documentation:** $80
- **Total:** **$400 + $80 = $480**

## Rationale
- **MySQL Specific Configuration:** The setup includes additional steps specific to MySQL, like enabling and configuring binary logging, which is crucial for CDC.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** The documentation not only covers technical setup but also provides operational guidance, which is essential for long-term maintenance. Charging 20% of the project fee for this is reasonable and ensures the client can manage the setup effectively.
