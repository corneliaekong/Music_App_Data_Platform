### Dockerfile

```Dockerfile
# Use an official PostgreSQL image as the base for the database
FROM postgres:15-alpine as postgres

# Environment variables for PostgreSQL
ENV POSTGRES_USER=db_user
ENV POSTGRES_PASSWORD=db_password
ENV POSTGRES_DB=dbt_database

# Use the official Python image to create a dbt service
FROM python:3.11-slim as dbt

# Install dbt dependencies
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir dbt-core dbt-postgres

# Set working directory for dbt
WORKDIR /usr/app/dbt

# Copy your dbt project into the container
COPY dbt_project/ .

# Run dbt commands (example: dbt run)
CMD ["dbt", "run"]

# Use an official Redash image as the base
FROM redash/redash:latest as redash

# Expose the port for Redash
EXPOSE 5000

# Copy Redash configuration (assuming you have one)
COPY redash_config /app/redash/

# Start Redash
CMD ["redash", "start"]

# Define a network to allow containers to communicate
FROM postgres as final

# Create a bridge network
FROM dbt as final

# Ensure dbt can connect to PostgreSQL
FROM redash as final

# Start the services using Docker Compose (added separately)
```

### Explanation

1. **Networking**:
   - Docker Compose will be used to create a bridge network that allows the PostgreSQL, dbt, and Redash containers to communicate with each other. The network is created automatically when using Docker Compose, and all services defined within the Compose file are connected to this network.

2. **PostgreSQL**:
   - The PostgreSQL service is defined using the official `postgres:15-alpine` image.
   - Environment variables are used to configure the database with a username, password, and database name.
   - The PostgreSQL container will listen on the default port `5432`.

3. **dbt**:
   - The dbt service is based on a slim Python image, and dbt is installed via `pip`.
   - The dbt project directory is copied into the container, and the `dbt run` command is set to execute by default.
   - dbt will connect to the PostgreSQL instance using a connection string that points to the network alias of the PostgreSQL container.

4. **Redash**:
   - Redash is based on the official Redash image.
   - The container is configured to expose port `5000`, which is Redash's default web interface.
   - The Redash instance is configured to connect to the PostgreSQL instance using the same network alias.

### Docker Compose File

To tie it all together, you'll need a Docker Compose file that defines these services and sets up the necessary network.

```yaml
version: '3.8'

services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:15-alpine
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: db_user
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: db_password
      POSTGRES_DB: dbt_database
    networks:
      - app-network

  dbt:
    image: dbt_image
    build:
      context: .
      dockerfile: Dockerfile
    volumes:
      - ./dbt_project:/usr/app/dbt
    depends_on:
      - postgres
    networks:
      - app-network

  redash:
    image: redash/redash:latest
    environment:
      REDASH_DATABASE_URL: "postgresql://db_user:db_password@postgres:5432/dbt_database"
    ports:
      - "5000:5000"
    depends_on:
      - postgres
    networks:
      - app-network

networks:
  app-network:
    driver: bridge
```

### Explanation of Docker Compose

- **services**:
  - `postgres`, `dbt`, and `redash` services are defined.
  - `depends_on` ensures that dbt and Redash wait for PostgreSQL to be ready before starting.
  
- **networks**:
  - The `app-network` is defined using the `bridge` driver, which allows containers to communicate with each other by name.
